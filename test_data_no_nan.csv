which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make what a disaster that would be wouldnt you agree but once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal,only one manager position per cityregion is open right now worked from home by phone or in person locally – your choice over 40 major cities still available you will earn 40 of the gross profit on your teams funded deals you will earn 40 of the gross profits from your teams renewals and stacks you will earn 10 of the client equity in your teams client base plus you will earn 60 of funded amount commissions on your own deals you will earn 50 of all extra fees charged on your own deals you will earn 50 of the client equity in your own client base if you are working in the merchant cash advancesmall business funding industry and want to create your own team of reps who can also have the ability to recruit their own reps in to your team and you want to get paid from all of their efforts then read this ad carefully our company has preferred relationships with over 30 different private funding sources and we have a great reputation our name is not in this ad to prevent us from showing up in google indexing under our company name which would then let our existing and potential clients know how much commission we all make what a disaster that would be wouldnt you agree but once we give you our name and you check us out you will see that we are the real deal we have management positions available to a limited number of individuals that are hungry to build a six figure income and client base in the small business funding industry we will only take on one manager to cover one geographic area city or state or region depending upon population density and that manager will have the right to recruit within your assigned territory and can have their team get deals funded from all over the country the best part is that this can all be done over the phone if you qualify your managers agreement allows you to build your own sales team of reps for our company and to get paid 40 of the gross profit on each of their funded deals gross profit for our agreement is the amount left over after the contracted reps on your team are paid their commissions your recruited reps earn either 3 5 or 6 on the funded amount of their deals depending upon the repayment term plus they earn 50 of any extra fees charged by our company an example would be if the deal is a good 50000 first position with a restaurant or trucking company or some industry that is inside the box for our type of business then we can now get up to 12 of the funded amount or more in some cases as a top sell rate commission from our funders plus we can charge fees on most first position deals of another 2 to 4 first positions being deals where no other funding is in place if we pay your rep 5 to 6 on a deal like that plus 50 of the fees then there is a lot of room left over for profit on 50k at 12 plus 3 in fees if the rep got 5 commission on the funded amount and 1 and 12 in fee commissions 3250 commission there would be 7  1 and 12 left in gross profit for our company and the manager to split 6040 so 4250 gross profit on that deal  a 1700 override commission for you the manager imagine 20 or more of those overrides per month even on the subprime deals 2nd 3rd positions gas stations sub 500 credit 6 months in business etc we can now get 6 to 8 of the funded amount plus charge 3 to 12 in fees depending upon the deal so on a real bad deal worst case scenario the reps gets 3 our company gets 3 on the funded as commission and our company and the rep split another 5 in fees on a 50k subprime deal that would equal 2750 in gross profit for our company which is an 1100 override commission for you as the manager your manager’s agreement also prevents you from be circumvented by your reps once they sign up through you they are locked in to you as long as you remain with our company and you even get paid residuals up to 2 years after your last active date with us if you ever left this opportunity is for a limited time and even though there is no set quota if some decent level of performance is not met then the opportunity would be revoked after 30 to 60 days we also would provide you with an ad to run in your designated city and would rereimburse you with override commissions paid  we would also provide you and your recruited reps with a company email and all of your recruiting must be done through that email we have a very unique way of selling these business funding products and it is working for our reps in a big way we will provide you with scripts and materials that you can give your reps but ultimately it will be up to you to a recruit them using our ad or your own and by using your contacts locally b train them using our scripts combined with your experience and industry knowledge c manage them keep them motivated answer questions and act as their liaison with our company if you do these 3 things and keep doing it then you will build a six figure income from this business if you do these things well you can build a huge income and a book of business that you can cash out on in the future should we sell or go public which is why we are in this business besides the great profit margins this is a very lucrative opportunity for the right person if you are not experienced in this business then do not reply to this ad if you are a rep sitting in someone elses business making 3 or 4 of the funded amount of your deals or less with little or no residuals and no client equity and want a chance to build your own team and get paid leveraged income and residual income from the efforts of others then we welcome you to apply we will only give this position to one person to cover any one city even though you and your team can get deals from all over the country you can only recruit reps on cl in your designated area but you may recruit offline wherever you want so when you apply be convincing enough for us to call you back again no experience in the mca industry no position    ,,,1,0,0,Full-time,Mid-Senior

or several of the following technologies dsl routers 80211 wireless vpn firewalls  the primary function of an engineering product manager is project management and technical oversight the individual manages the odm to ensure that products are delivered in a timely fashion to a high quality and in accordance with the procedures and systems in addition the individual oversees the activities between the component vendors and the odm within the service provider group another important project management aspect is working with the sales engineers to get products approved at service providers the individual must manage the technical issues that arise during the approval process and ensure a rapid resolution by working with and through the sales engineers odms and component vendors a word from the recruiter some of the exciting things that retain engineers here are the new technologies that we integrate into our products most people hear about these technologies 9 months after the product development has launched our engineers actually start learning about the new technologies in advance of any silicon introductions in most cases we are an early partner to silicon vendors and help guide the silicon features this is extremely rare for many of the new members once they do the first project they want more and more as you can imagine the value of that engineer is much greater then when they walked in the door most engineers that i interview have been disappointed by their employers and when asked how much ownership they have of the product they developed the answer is always something like  i only did this this portion of the software or some portion of the chip or some portion of the hardware not much of an empowerment here  here the pe is the complete owner of every molecule of the product including mechanical operation finance cost etc this empowerment is another added value boost an engineer could benefit from this value is rare and will push the engineer in the direction of someday running a business end to end with a larger responsibility and scope the more of these projects they take the faster they reach that level of career growth and maturity this is what not shared on the jd how you will mature your career job responsibilities • for assigned projects take overall responsibility for delivering the product to production including requirements
